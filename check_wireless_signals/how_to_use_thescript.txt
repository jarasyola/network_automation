# What is this script about?
This script is written to proactively send emails when clients signals are more than 
the set threshold_signal. This works on Mikrotik radios/routers - tested on v6 and v7 ROS

# Requirements
a. The script use the module - librouteros, so you should install it.

b. You need to change the routers login credentials and credentials for sending email.

   -- Login credentials
        {"host": "router1_ip", "username": "username1", "password": "password1"},
        {"host": "router2_ip", "username": "username2", "password": "password2"},

   -- Sending email credentials
        smtp_server = "your_smtp_server"
        smtp_port = 587
        smtp_username = "your_email@example.com"
        smtp_password = "your_email_password"
        to_emails = ["recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com"]

# How to run a script in Ubuntu Server 
To schedule the script to run automatically at 8 am every morning on an Ubuntu Linux box, 
you can use the cron scheduler. Here are the steps to set it up:

-- Open your terminal.

Edit the crontab file for the user under which you want to run the script. Use the following command:

Run command below:
crontab -e

Add the following line to the crontab file to schedule the script to run every day at 8 am:

Paste the code below on your open file:

0 8 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
Make sure to replace /path/to/your/script.py with the actual path to your Python script. 
If you are unsure about the Python executable path, you can find it by running which python3 in the terminal.

Save the file and exit the editor.

This cron schedule is set to run at 8 am every day. The 0 in the first position represents the minute, and 8 in the second position represents the hour. The asterisks in the other positions mean every day of the month, every month, and every day of the week.

Make sure your Python script has the executable permission. You can grant it using the following command:

--Run the command below:

chmod +x /path/to/your/script.py
This setup will automatically run your script at 8 am every day. Adjust the cron schedule according to your needs.
